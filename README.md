# CPU-Scheduler
System for Deterministic Modeling of CPU Scheduling Algorithms

To compile and run the program:
1. Create two packages: main and Test
2. Copy Analyzer.java and Process.java to main ; Testing.java to Test
3. The program should compile and run properly.
4. Analyzer is a utility class, so you need to just create Process objects, add them to a list and run analyzer's methods on them, 
like I have demoed in the Testing file.
